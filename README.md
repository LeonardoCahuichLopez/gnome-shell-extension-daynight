## gnome-shell-extension-daynight

A simple gnome-extension button on the GNOME's top panel to toggle between light / dark themes.

Note: Currently this extension will only switch between Adwaita and Adwaita-dark themes and this will be the state until the extension's settings widget is fully developed.
